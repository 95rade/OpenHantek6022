OpenHantek is a free software for Hantek and compatible (Voltcraft/Darkwire/Protek/Acetech) USB digital signal oscilloscopes. 
It was initially developed by [David Gr√§ff and others](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek/graphs/contributors) on [github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek). After David [stopped maintaining](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek/issues/277) the programm I cloned the repo to provide some updates - but only for Hantek 6022BE/BL on the linux platform.

* DSO2xxx Series and DSO52xx Series support is still in but untested due to missing devices.
