OpenHantek6022 is a free software for Hantek and compatible (Voltcraft/Darkwire/Protek/Acetech) USB digital signal oscilloscopes. 
It was initially developed by [David Gr√§ff and others](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek/graphs/contributors) on [github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek). 
After David [stopped maintaining](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek/issues/277) the programm I cloned the repo to provide updates - only for Hantek 6022BE/BL.

<img alt="Image of main window on linux" width="100%" src="docs/images/screenshot_mainwindow.png">

* Supported devices: Hantek 6022BE and 6022BL as well as compatible scopes (e.g. Voltcraft DSO-2020).
* Fully supported operating system: Linux (developed under debian stable).
* Compiles under FreeBSD (packaging / installation: work in progress, thx @tspspi).
* Other operating systems builds: [Windows](docs/images/screenshot_mainwindow_win.png) (partly tested) & MacOSX (untested).
* Uses [free open source firmware](https://github.com/Ho-Ro/Hantek6022API), no longer dependent on nonfree Hantek firmware.
* Extensive [User Manual](docs/OpenHantek6022_User_Manual.pdf) with technical specs and schematics.

## Features

* Voltage and Spectrum view for all device supported chanels.
* CH1 and CH2 name becomes red when input is clipped (bottom left).
* Checkbox for X10 probes. 
* Measure and display Vpp, RMS, DC (average), AC (rms) and AC as dB values as well as frequency of active channels.
* Math channel modes: Ch1+Ch2, Ch1-Ch2, Ch2-Ch1, Ch1*Ch2 and AC part of Ch1 or Ch2.
* Time base 100 ms/div .. 10 ns/div.
* Sample rates 100, 200, 500 kS/s, 1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 15, 24, 30 MS/s.
* Downsampling (up to 100x) increases solution and SNR.
* Downsampling sample rates 10, 20, 50 kS/s.
* Calibration output square wave signal frequency can be selected between 50 Hz .. 100 kHz in 1/2/5 steps.
* Trigger modes: Normal, Auto and Single with green/red status display (top left).
* Calibration values loaded from eeprom or a model configuration file.
* [Calibration program](https://github.com/Ho-Ro/Hantek6022API/blob/master/README.md#create-calibration-values-for-openhantek) to create these values automatically.
* Sinc interpolation for fast timebase settings.
* Digital phosphor effect to notice even short spikes.
* A [zoom view](docs/images/screenshot_mainwindow_with_zoom.png) with a freely selectable range.
* Cursor measurement function for voltage, time, amplitude and frequency.
* Export to CSV, JPG, PNG or print the graphs.
* Freely configurable colors.
* The dock views on the main window can be customized by dragging them around and stacking them.
  This allows a minimum window size of 640*480 for old workstation computers.
* All settings can be saved to a configuration file and loaded again.

## Install prebuilt binary
* Get Linux (and untested Win) packages from the [Releases](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/releases) page.
* Get MacOSX package from [macports](https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=openhantek) - thx [ra1nb0w](https://github.com/ra1nb0w).
* Get [Fedora rpm packages](https://pkgs.org/download/openhantek) - thx [Vascom](https://github.com/Vascom).
* [Download (untested) Windows build from last commit](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Ho-Ro/openhantek6022/build/artifacts).
* The MacOSX archive from Releases contains only the binary, you have to provide the necessary libraries on your own! Please have a look at the [build instructions](docs/build.md#apple).


## Building OpenHantek from source
You need the following software, to build OpenHantek from source:
* [CMake 3.5+](https://cmake.org/download/)
* [Qt 5.4+](https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source/)
* [FFTW 3+ (prebuild files will be downloaded on windows)](http://www.fftw.org/)
* libusb-1.0, version >= 1.0.16 (prebuild files will be used on windows)
* A compiler that supports C++11 - tested with gcc, clang and msvc

We have build instructions available for [Linux](docs/build.md#linux), [Apple MacOSX](docs/build.md#macosx) and [Microsoft Windows](docs/build.md#windows).

## Run OpenHantek
With the original OpenHantek version you needed an OpenGL 3.2+ or OpenGL ES 2.0+ capable graphics hardware.
OpenHantek6022 runs also on legacy HW/SW (OpenGL 2.1+ or OpenGL ES 1.2+) with the patch [coozoo@01b42d3](https://github.com/coozoo/openhantek/commit/01b42d3db2921a0aa83ea6808147ea6257de3f28)
OpenGL is preferred, if available. Overwrite this behaviour by starting OpenHantek
from the command line like this: `OpenHantek --useGLES`.

USB access for the device is required:
* As seen on the [Microsoft Windows build instructions](docs/build.md#windows) page, you have to assign an usb driver to the device.
The original Hantek driver doesn't work.
* On Linux, you need to copy the file `firmware/60-hantek.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` or `/lib/udev/rules.d/` and replug your device.

## Important!
The scope doesn't store the firmware permanently in flash or eeprom, it must be uploaded after each power-up and is kept in ram 'til power-down.
If the scope was used with a different software (old openhantek, sigrok or the windows software) the scope must be unplugged and replugged one-time before using it with OpenHantek6022 to enable the automatic loading of the correct firmware.
The top line of the program must display the correct firmware version (FW0202).

## Specifications, features, limitations and developer documentation
Please refer to the [specifications, features, limitations](docs/limitations.md) and the [developer documentation](openhantek/readme.md) pages.

## Contribute
We welcome any reported Github Issue if you have a problem with this software. Send us a pull request for enhancements and fixes. Some random notes:
   - Read [how to properly contribute to open source projects on GitHub][10].
   - Create a separate branch other than *master* for your changes. It is not possible to directly commit to master on this repository.
   - Write [good commit messages][11].
   - Use the same [coding style and spacing][13]
     (install clang-format. Use make target: `make format` or execute directly from the openhantek directory: `clang-format -style=file src/*`).
   - Open a [pull request][12] with a clear title and description.
   - Read [Add a new device](docs/adddevice.md) if you want to know how to add a device.
   - We recommend QtCreator as IDE on all platforms. It comes with CMake support, a decent compiler, and Qt out of the box.
